sQuid
=====

sQuid is an open-source C++/Qt application for observing environments using multiple high-speed cameras, while interacting with these environments through a port interface. We envision that this application will be very useful in **scientific research as well as robotics**.

In our experiments, we control a **system of LEDs and valves while multiple cameras** capture visual information from the environment. Specifically, fruit flies (*Drosophila melanogaster*) are placed within a transparent chamber to visualize their behavior. While capturing images from two cameras, we simultaneously control a series of LEDs to excite fluorescence proteins, and generate gas flow by controlling a series of valves.
